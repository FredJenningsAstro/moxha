# MOXHA

A pipeline to generate mock X-ray observations with pyXSIM and SOXS, and analyse them with spectral and profile fitting. Included are tools for background subtraction, simple de-projection, and the calculation of the posterior distributions for profile-fitting parameters using threeML.

## To set-up:
python setup.py build && python setup.py install
